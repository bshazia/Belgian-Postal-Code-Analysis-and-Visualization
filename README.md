# Belgian Postal Code Analysis and Visualization
 This project aims to analyze Belgian postal codes to identify those consisting of one or more identical numbers and visualize the results on a map.  Using this data, the program filters out postal codes meeting the specified criteria and displays them alongside their associated city names on a map.
